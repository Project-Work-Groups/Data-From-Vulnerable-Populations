# BPDMTutorial

This repo contains materials for a tutorial on Algorithmic Fairness presented by Flavio Calmon and Caitlin Kuhlman at the Broadening Participation in Data Mining Workshop (BPDM) @KDD 2017 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and by Caitlin Kuhlman at [BPDM @Howard University](http://www.dataminingshop.com/web/) in 2019.

All tutorial materials use Python to analyze real data and demonstrate concepts from the study of Algorithmic Fairness. This analysis is inspired by many recent research papers on this topic. Please see the references and links throughout the notebooks for more information.

This material is intended to be a hands-on teaching tool. If you have suggestions or ideas to improve it please get in touch! cakuhlman@wpi.edu

The notebook tutorial-COMPAS.ipynb contains an example analysis of the COMPAS recidivism dataset published by ProPublica here https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis. It introduces a number of fairness metrics for evaluting group outcomes.
